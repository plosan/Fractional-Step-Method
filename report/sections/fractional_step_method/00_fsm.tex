Hereinafter, it is assumed that the studied problems occur in a contractible bounded open set $\Omega \subset \real^3$ with smooth boundary. Besides, these problems last for finite time, that is to say, the time interval is $I = [t_0, t_f] \subset \real$.

\chapter{Fractional Step Method}

In this Chapter the Fractional Step Method (FSM) is introduced and justified. \colorbox{red}{asdsadas}

Hereinafter, it is assumed that the studied PDEs occur in a bounded open set $\Omega \subset \real^3$ with boundary as smooth as necessary, and last for finite time, that is to say, the time interval is $I = (0, t_\text{max}) \subset \real$ with $t_\text{max} > 0$.
